= Foreword

The aim of this book is to introduce you to alternative ways of
accessing screen based technology if using a standard mouse or making
selections on a touchscreen is tricky. Alternative access can open up a
new world of communication opportunities through voice output
communication software and apps, and the ability to access software and
apps that can support writing and broader computer use.

Each access method probably warrants its own book(!), so this can only
offer an introduction to what's available and how to get started.
However, wherever possible we will signpost you to further information
and resources.

A range of resources that complement this book can be downloaded from
acecentre.org.uk.
