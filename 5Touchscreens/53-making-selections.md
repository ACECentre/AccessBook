= Making Selections with a Touchscreen

what can help - screen setting adjustments, touch guides etc.

Some people find it easier to activate the touchscreen using a touch enabling device.  These can really help when isolating a finger or a specific part of the hand is tricky.  All sorts of different things can be used, from a pencil with a rubber on the end, a special stylus, an adapted glove with all of the fingers except the index finger sewn down to the palm, to a custom made splint.  If a touchscreen is going to be used in this way, the touch enabling device must be both practical and available at all times. \(pic examples\)
