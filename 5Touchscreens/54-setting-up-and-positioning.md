= Setting up and Positioning Touchscreens

Not sure there's going to be much about 'set up' per se but certainly  
can talk about positioning issues here.  Also could maybe talk about different options regarding position of info onscreen if areas hard to reach, and maybe about issues around 'locking' areas of screen using guided access or similar.
