## Standard Mice

We are probably all experienced in used a standard mouse to control a cursor on screen based technology.  A standard mouse is a handheld unit that you rest your hand on top of and physically move around on a flat surface to control an onscreen cursor.  Most standard mice have two buttons along the top known as the left and right buttons, plus a wheel for scrolling. However the  number of buttons can vary.  Although we use the term 'standard', even the most mainstream mice now come in all sorts of colours, shapes and sizes.  There are also a number of smaller standard mice on the market that are intended to be easier to use for children.

In the past, mice had a ball fitted in their base, but modern mice make use of optical sensors.  The old fashioned mechanical mice required even more movement than the optical mice now do, and were rather prone to being sticky! The more modern optical and laser mice rely on LEDs \(light emitting diodes\) to detect two dimensional movement relative to a flat surface.  They are the most common type of mouse on the market.

Most standard mice have two built in left and right buttons to facilitate making selections with the onscreen cursor, although the number does vary, and a wheel for scrolling.  The scroll wheel can usually be used as a third button.  Mice optimised for computer gaming \(gaming mice\) may have many more buttons.

Most standard mice are a fairly similar shape \(gently curved like the body of a mouse\), and involve the hand being in a horizontal position resting over it.  Ergonomic mice look a little different, and aim either to put the hand or wrist in a more 'natural' position, perhaps rotating the palm so it is more vertical, and / or to change the way the arm moves when using the mouse to reduce wrist movement.  Ergonomic mice are intended to be more comfortable to use and to reduce injuries such as repetitive strain injury \(RSI\).

Both wireless and wired \(typically usb\) versions of standard mice are readily available.

_What skills do you need to use a standard mouse?_

A standard mouse requires coordinated hand and arm movement.  You need to be able to move the mouse unit around on a flat surface.  If the built in mouse buttons are to be used, some controlled finger movement and pressure is required to operate them.

_Any contraindications?_

A standard mouse may not suit someone who finds coordinated hand and arm movement difficult.  It may not suit someone with positioning issues who would find it hard to manipulate the mouse unit on a flat surface.

_Examples of standard mice_

Standard mice are available from a wide variety of sellers.

_Advantages_

Most standard mice are plug and play which makes them very flexible.

Standard mice can be bought very cheaply and they are widely available.

_Disadvantages_

To accurately access the whole screen, hand and arm movement is required in all directions.

Standard mice require a smooth flat space to move them around on.

Research suggests excessive use could lead to health problems including repetitive strain injury \(RSI\).

Need to put the gyroscopic mouse info somewhere:  air, inertial and gyroscopic mice - these are mice that detect movement in three dimensions without the need for a flat surface.
