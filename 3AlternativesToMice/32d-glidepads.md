# Glidepads\*=

A glidepad is a special surface that contains touch sensors.  These touch sensors translate the movement and position of someone's finger\(s\) into control of an onscreen cursor.  Glidepads are sometimes known as trackpads or touchpads.

Most laptops have a glidepad built in as standard in front of the keyboard.  However, what a lot of people don't realise is that glidepads are also available separately, either with a usb connection or wireless.  They come in a wide range of sizes - for those with small finger movement, there is even a glidepad the size of a stamp available!

A glidepad can sense both movement and pressure, and can be used with more than one finger.  Glidepads often come with separate left and right click butttons, as on a mouse.  However, some do not, and rely on gestures on the glidepad to achieve these functions.  Some glidepads have specific areas for different functions e.g. gliding a finger down the side might be used for scrolling.  A few glidepads also support tap zones, which are regions on the glidepad that can execute a function e.g. pausing a media player.

Many glidepads are plug and play.   However, some come with additional software which enables them to be personalised to a greater degree.

_What skills do you need to use a glidepad?_

Glidepads require controlled finger movement.  If you are using gestures and / or tapzones for additional control, this will need to be learned and understood.

_Examples of glidepads_

Glidepoint touchpads, Cirque, logitech, lenovo

\*it would be good to have some photographs of different glidepads, ideally with someone's finger to give a sense of relative size\*

_Advantages_

A glidepad can work particularly well for someone with good fine finger control.  It requires much less movement than is required for a standard mouse and may place less strain on the hand.  A very small glidepad can help to maximise the control of technology for someone who is unable to move their finger very far.

Glidepads allow for much more flexible positioning than a standard mouse. If you are using a glidepad on a table or desk, it can be fixed in one place which means you need much less space. However, because the whole mouse doesn’t need to be moved to move the onscreen cursor, you don’t actually need to use it on a hard surface. It can be positioned anywhere that is comfortable.  They are also small and easy to rotate if you need to meet more complicated positioning needs e.g. controlling a computer whilst lying on your side.

_Disadvantages_

Glidepads can take a bit of time to get used to - particularly when you are used to using a standard mouse.  

Glidepads rely on fairly fine motor movements, which will not suit everyone, and some may struggle to learn or execute the additional finger gestures that can help you get the most out of the glidepad.  

They can also be rather sensitive!
