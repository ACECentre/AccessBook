# Touchpads\*=

A touchpad is a special surface that contains touch sensors.  These touch sensors translate the movement and position of someone's finger\(s\) into control of an onscreen cursor.  Touchpads are sometimes known as trackpads or glidepads.

Most laptops have a touchpad built in as standard in front of the keyboard, and some external keyboards also come with them built in.  However, what a lot of people don't realise is that touchpads are also available separately, either with a usb connection or wireless.  They come in a wide range of sizes - for those with small finger movement, there is even a touchpad available that is  the size of a stamp!

A touchpad can sense both movement and pressure, and can be used with more than one finger.  Touchpads often come with separate left and right click butttons, as on a mouse.  However, some do not, and rely on gestures on the touchpad to achieve these functions.  Some touchpads have specific areas for different functions e.g. gliding a finger down the side might be used for scrolling.  A few touchpads also support tap zones, which are regions on the touchpad that can execute a function e.g. pausing a media player.

Many touchpads are plug and play.   However, some come with additional software which enables them to be personalised to a greater degree, if the platform supports this.

_What skills do you need to use a touchpad?_

Touchpads require controlled finger movement.  If you are using gestures and / or tapzones for additional control, this will need to be learned and understood.

As with all mice and mice alternatives, touchpads can be used alongside dwell select software so that no buttons need to be pressed at all. \*this is another example of a 'standard' comment - in rollerballs it appears under advantages but makes less sense here - need to think through these standard remarks\*

_Any contraindications?_

_Examples of touchpads_

You will find a wide range of touchapds available from mainstream sellers like Amazon.  Specific examples include Glidepoint touchpads \(e.g. [http://www.inclusive.co.uk/glidepoint-touchpads-p2406\](http://www.inclusive.co.uk/glidepoint-touchpads-p2406%29%29 and the Mini Touchpad %28www.ergonomictouchpad.com/mini_touchpad.php%29\) and the Mini Touchpad \(www.ergonomictouchpad.com/mini\_touchpad.php\).  \*do we want to extend this list - how comprehensive should we be e.g. microsoft arc touch, cirque, logitech, lenovo etc.\*

\*it would be good to have some photographs of different touchpads, ideally with someone's finger to give a sense of relative size\*

_Advantages_

A touchpad can work particularly well for someone with good fine motor control of their finger but more limited arm movement.  It requires much less movement than is required for a standard mouse and may place less strain on the hand.  A small touchpad can help to maximise the control of technology for someone who is has a very limited amount of controlled finger movement.

Touchpads allow for much more flexible positioning than a standard mouse. If you are using a touchpad on a table or desk, it can be fixed in one place which means you need much less space. However, because the whole mouse doesn’t need to be moved to move the onscreen cursor, you don’t actually need to use it on a hard surface. It can be positioned anywhere that is comfortable.  They are also small and easy to rotate if you need to meet more complicated positioning needs e.g. controlling a computer whilst lying on your side.

_Disadvantages_

Touchpads can take a bit of time to get used to - particularly when you are more familiar with using a standard mouse.

Touchpads rely on fairly fine motor movements, which will not suit everyone, and some may struggle to learn or execute the additional finger gestures that can help you get the most out of the touchpad.

Not all additional functions will be available on all platforms.  For example, if the touchpad comes with additional software to maximise control, this may not work on an Android platform. \*is this correct\* \*if so, probably also a point to make for all mouse alternatives?\* \*in fact, do we need a heading about platforms?!\*

They can also be rather sensitive!

As with all mice, wireless models will contain batteries that will need to be replaced along the way. \*this needs to be a 'standard' disadvantage\*
