## Rollerball mouse

_nb. doesn't one of our potential case studies use a rollerball with his foot?  Have therefore added in that typically is hand and mouse but leaving door open.  Wonder if need to be more explicit about this._

A rollerball is a type of mouse with a rotating ball that is typically moved with a finger or thumb. With a standard optical mouse, you need to move the whole mouse unit in order to move the onscreen pointer, whereas with a rollerball, you simply move the ball on the unit.  As a result, rollerball mice can be useful for people who have reduced movement, or who find the amount of movement involved in operating a standard mouse fatiguing.

Rollerball mice are available in a wide variety of shapes, sizes and weights, ranging from large colourful devices aimed at the early years market to miniature handheld device aimed primarily at people giving presentations.  Sometimes separate left and right handed versions are available. The wide range of rollerball mice means that they can suit many different wrist positions and resting shape of hands.  

For example, from slight rotation outwards \(pic example of ergonomic with wrist slightly rotated?\)

For example, or with a flat palm and wrist \(pic example\)

The miniature handheld versions can work particularly well for people who have a highly controllable but small movement e.g. some people with muscular dystrophy.  \(pic example\)

The function buttons available on a rollerball mouse vary.  Some offer left and right click only, while others offer hold and drag, speed adjustments and even a setting that permits movement on the x/y axis only.  As an alternative to using the built in function buttons, some rollerballs have switch ports which means that you can plug in external switches which then take on the functions such as the left click.

Rollerballs can be connected to screen based technology via usb or Bluetooth, depending upon the model.

_What skills do you need to use a rollerball mouse?_

As with all mice, coordinated movement is required.  In most cases, a rollerball will be operated using hand and / or finger movement.  However, the exact nature of the movement and control required varies according to the model.  For example, a finger mouse can be used with a stabilised wrist and movement in the thumb and index finger only.  A mouse with a larger trackball, however, may require movement of the wrist left to right.  _something here about using it with other body parts?!?_

_Advantages_

The majority of rollerball mice are plug and play, which means they can be used on a wide range of screen based technology without first installing any specialist software.  This makes them a portable and flexible access method.

Rollerball mice allow for much more flexible positioning than a standard mouse. If you are using a rollerball mouse on a table or desk, it can be fixed in one place which means you need much less space. However, because the whole mouse doesn’t need to be moved to move the onscreen cursor, you don’t actually need to use it on a hard surface. It can be held in the hand, used on the arm of a chair, on a lap or even on a pillow.  To further assist flexible positioning, some rollerball mice can be customised to enable them to be used ‘sideways’, and some allow you to reverse left and right mouse click function buttons.

For those that find pressing buttons difficult, rollerball mice support different selection methods.  Some offer a modified range of integrated function buttons, while others allow external switches to be used. As with all mice and mice alternatives, rollerball mice can be used alongside dwell select software so that no buttons need to be pressed at all.

_Disadvantages_

As with all mice, a rollerball can only be used to control a device that uses an onscreen cursor.

It can take a little practice when transitioning from a standard mouse as it is a quite different movement.

Some people can become distracted by spinning or flicking the ball itself.

Rollerball mice have a tendency to continue with movement of the ball even after the individual has come away, and for those using large movements this can lead to inaccuracy.
