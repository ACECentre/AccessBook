## Rollerball mouse

_nb. doesn't one of our potential case studies use a rollerball with his foot?  Have therefore added in that typically is hand and mouse but leaving door open.  Wonder if need to be more explicit about this.  Also didn't talk much about people who may use bigger sweeping movements so have added a bit in._

A rollerball mouse has a rotating ball that is typically moved with a finger or thumb.  With a standard mouse, you need to physically move the whole mouse unit to move the onscreen pointer.  However, with a rollerball mouse, it is only the ball that is moved.  The unit itself remains in one place.   As a result, rollerball mice can be useful for people who have reduced movement, or who find the amount of movement involved in operating a standard mouse fatiguing.  Rollerball mice can also be useful for people who have some controlled movement, but find it hard to control their movements sufficiently to use a standard mouse.

Rollerball mice are available in a wide variety of shapes, sizes and weights, ranging from large colourful devices aimed at the early years market to miniature handheld device aimed primarily at people giving presentations.  Sometimes separate left and right handed versions are available. The wide range of rollerball mice on offer makes it more likely that one can be found to suit many different wrist positions and resting shape of hands.

For example, or with a flat palm and wrist \(pic example\)

The miniature handheld versions can work particularly well for people who have a highly controllable but small movement e.g. some people with muscular dystrophy.  \(pic example\)

The function buttons available on a rollerball mouse vary.  Some offer left and right click only, while others offer hold and drag, speed adjustments and even a setting that permits movement on the x/y axis only.  As an alternative to using the built in function buttons, some rollerball mice have switch ports.  This means that you can plug in an external switch\(es\) which then take on functions such as the left click.

As with standard mice, both wireless and wired \(typically usb\) versions of rollerball mice are available.

_What skills do you need to use a rollerball mouse?_

As with all mice, some degree of coordinated and controlled movement is required.  In most cases, a rollerball will be operated using hand and / or finger movement, although some choose to use other body parts.  The exact nature of the movement and control required varies according to the model of rollerball mouse.  For example, a miniature handheld rollerball mouse can be controlled with movement of just the thumb and index finger, while the wrist is stabilised.  A larger rollerball mouse however, may require movement of the wrist left to right in addition to hand / finger movement.  

_Any contraindications?_

Although rollerball mice require less movement and control than a standard mouse, they do still need coordinated and controlled movement some body part \(typically hand and / or finger\).  If this is too difficult, an alternative access method should be considered.

_Advantages_

As with standard mice, the majority of rollerball mice are plug and play, which means they can be used on a wide range of screen based technology without first installing any specialist software.  This makes them a portable and flexible access method.

Rollerball mice come in a wide range of sizes and shapes.  This means they can suit a wider range of types of movement, from a small and precise thumb movement to a larger hand sweep.

Rollerball mice allow for much more flexible positioning than a standard mouse. If you are using a rollerball mouse on a table or desk, it can be fixed in one place which means you need much less space and consequently also much less movement. A key advantage of a rollerball mouse is that in common with other mouse alternatives like joysticks and touchpads, they do not have to be used on a hard surface at all.  A rollerball mouse can be held in the hand, positioned on the arm of a chair, on a lap or even on a pillow.  To further assist flexible positioning, some rollerball mice can be customised to enable them to be used ‘sideways’, and some allow you to reverse left and right mouse click function buttons.

For those that find pressing the mouse function buttons difficult, rollerball mice may support different selection methods.  Some offer a modified range of integrated function buttons, while others allow external switches to be connected. As with all mice and mice alternatives, rollerball mice can be used alongside dwell select software so that no buttons need to be pressed at all.

_Disadvantages_

As with all mice, a rollerball can only be used to control a device that uses an onscreen cursor. _- is this relevant?  Maybe belongs in section 31 or 32._

It can take a little practice when transitioning from a standard mouse as it is a quite different movement.

Some people can become distracted by spinning or flicking the ball itself.

The ball of a rollerball mouse can have a tendency to continue to rotate after the individual has stopped moving it.  This is particularly true when the ball is being moved with large movements.  This continued rotation can lead to inaccuracy.
