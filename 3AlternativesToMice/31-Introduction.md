# Introduction to Mice and Mice Alternatives

Mice tend to be used with computers and laptops, but are sometimes used to control a Windows tablet or even an Android tablet.

Mice can be really useful for precise targetting, and a range of  different shapes and sizes are readily available in mainstream shops.  More specialist alternatives are also available.

When using a standard mouse, you need to physically move the whole mouse around on a flat surface in order to move the onscreen pointer. This movement requires the use of many parts of your arm, from clicking the buttons with your fingers, moving left and right with your wrist, and even using your shoulder and elbow to move the mouse forward and back. For some people, this range of movement is difficult or fatiguing and so an alternative might be considered.

With both standard mice and mice alternatives, there is often a lot that can be done within the platform settings to change how the mouse or mouse alternative works, and making them easier to use and / or easier to see.  For example, if the onscreen pointer speed is reduced, this may help with accuracy for someone who is struggling to coordinate their movements.  Conversely, if the pointer speed is increased, less movement is required which may help someone with more limited movement.  To support someone in seeing the onscreen pointer, you can change its size and colour, for example, or have a trail displayed to help you to keep track of its location.  This area is covered in more detail in 33 - link. 

_What skills do you need to use a mouse?_

Mouse use requires some sort of coordinated movement in order to move an onscreen cursor in multiple directions.

All standard mice and mice alternatives require some general knowledge and skills around controlling an onscreen cursor, making selections, and dragging and dropping. This requires a higher level of understanding than the more direct pointer control offered by a touchscreen.  However, software and activities such as My First Mouse and IT Mouse Skills are available to support this learning.  See the skill development section for more information \[link\]

_Any contraindications?_

Although there are a wide range of mouse alternatives available, they all require some sort of coordinated movement.  If this is difficult, another type of access method should be considered.
