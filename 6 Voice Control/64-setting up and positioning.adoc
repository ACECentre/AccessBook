= Setting up and Positioning Voice Control

Most voice control software needs to learn a userâ€™s voice before being used functionally.  This training process improves accuracy and teaches the software how an individual pronounces specific words.  

Accuracy can be helped by using a good quality microphone.  Some microphones can help to filter out background noise if this is an issue.
