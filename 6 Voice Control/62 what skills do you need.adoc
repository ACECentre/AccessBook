*What skills do you need?*

nb. what person are we going to write in...  Also is going to be a chapter on skill development - do we mention anything about that side of things here?

Using your voice to control a computer is very different to speaking to someone in a face-to-face conversation or chatting with friends. You need to be able to speak at a clear consistent pace, and to use a consistent tone.  

However, the biggest difference is that when writing using voice control, you need to speak in complete sentences.  Written language is different to spoken language and so this will take a bit of getting used to!  The key is to plan what you want to write before you say it. 

Something about dysarthric speech here..?  Does come in later
