*What is voice control?*


_Voice control, voice recognition, speech recognition_

Voice control is one way of controlling a computer or tablet.  No physical movement is required, and the entire computer can be controlled using just your voice.  Voice control used to be something quite unusual that was only used with expensive specialist software.  However, it is now turning up in all sorts of mainstream applications, from Siri on an iPhone to the Amazon echo.

Voice control is available across a range of platforms, including Windows, iOS and android.

When voice control works well and is accurate, it can be a fairly quick way of writing / recording.  [can we expand on this – any comparative measures around? Also decide on terminology around writing / recording]

Most voice control software needs to learn a user’s voice before being used functionally.  This training process improves accuracy and teaches the software how an individual pronounces specific words.  

Accuracy can be helped by using a good quality microphone.  Some microphones can help to filter out background noise if this is an issue.

Voice control requires the use of some specific spoken commands such as “show desktop”, “drag mouse down faster” and “press enter”.  These commands will need to be learned, but for individuals who find remembering them tricky, a cheatsheet next to the computer can help.

Voice control doesn’t work for everyone.  However, as technology changes and improves, it may be worth re-visiting in the future even if it is not found to be useful now.
