*Advantages*

As voice control relies solely on speech, it can be an effective means of computer control for people with reduced motor skills.  It can also be useful for people with visual impairments.

One of the key advantages of voice control is that it can be used whilst lying in bed, reclining on the sofa, standing up, indeed in any position so long as you are able to speak.  This makes it very flexible for those who have a range of physical needs.

Because the software spells the word it hears, it can work well for people who know what they want to say, but find spelling difficult.      

So long as you know the commands to use, voice control can give full computer control.
