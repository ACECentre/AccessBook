# The Basics

I think this chapter is going to set out some of the key themes that  
will have cropped up in the case studies.

Have mentioned access method according to task in intro but maybe  
expand.

Talk about assessment and multidisciplinary team

When identifying an appropriate access method \(s\) for an individual, there are some key factors to think about.  These include the amount of effort that is involved in making a selection using the device and the amount of movement that is required to use it.  The durability of the proposed access method may also be an important consideration as it needs to be reliable.

Talk about importance of seating and positioning - a before and after  
photo showing the implications of bad / good seating would be great. AAC  
Rerc have done paper on effect of seating on access. Recommend contact  
local services.

Talk about importance of positioning equipment properly - some obviously  
ridiculous photos of people looking up at monitors way too high or  
having a roller ball way off to one side etc etc

Talk about what can be achieved - toys, games, mobility, environmental  
control, communication, computer use etc

Reassure that work working at very early level as can lead to more -  
i.e. answer the 'what's the point' of this question

Talk about the importance of team work and good liaison with school,  
home etc etc
