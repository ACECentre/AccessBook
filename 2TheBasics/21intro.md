= The Basics

I think this chapter is going to set out some of the key themes that
will have cropped up in the case studies.

Have mentioned access method according to task in intro but maybe
expand.

Talk about assessment and multidisciplinary team

Talk about importance of seating and positioning - a before and after
photo showing the implications of bad / good seating would be great. AAC
Rerc have done paper on effect of seating on access. Recommend contact
local services.

Talk about importance of positioning equipment properly - some obviously
ridiculous photos of people looking up at monitors way too high or
having a roller ball way off to one side etc etc

Talk about what can be achieved - toys, games, mobility, environmental
control, communication, computer use etc

Reassure that work working at very early level as can lead to more -
i.e. answer the 'what's the point' of this question

Talk about the importance of team work and good liaison with school,
home etc etc
